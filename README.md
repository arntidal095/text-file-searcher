# 🔍 Text File Searcher

A simple Python script that searches through all `.txt` files in the current folder (and subfolders) for a word you specify.  
When a match is found, it prints the file name, the line number, and the matching line.  
It also copies matching files into a `backup_folder` for easy access.
